# ishappynumber(n) [10 pts]
# A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the 
# number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will 
# stay ), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 
# are happy numbers.

# Write the function ishappynumber(n) which takes a possibly-negative integer and returns True if it is happy and 
# False otherwise. Note that all numbers less than 1 are not happy. Here are some test assertions for you:
# assert(ishappynumber(-7) == False)
# assert(ishappynumber(1) == True)
# assert(ishappynumber(2) == False)
# assert(ishappynumber(97) == True)
# assert(ishappynumber(98) == False)
# assert(ishappynumber(404) == True)
# assert(ishappynumber(405) == False)

def happy(val):
	sum = 0
	while(val > 0):
		sum += (val%10)**2
		val = val//10
	return sum

def ishappynumber(n):
	# your code goes here
	list1 = []
	while True:
		if(n == 1):
				print(list1)
				return True
		if(n in list1):
				print("here", list1)
				return False
		list1.append(n)
		n = happy(n)
